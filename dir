The directory structure is organized in the following way:

Structure description:                                                         
                                                                               
[root] ------- root folder for entire object. Except listed subfolders contains
               installation scripts (Wise, NSIS, VisualBuildPro, etc.), LICENSE
               and README files.                                               
[bin] -------- created by the build tasks and used to hold project-wide build  
               items such as compiled source, assembled modules, or files      
               generated by the some doc tool.                                 
[doc] -------- contains all the documentation for a project, including HTML    
               files, installation and setup files, etc.                       
[etc] -------- project distribution scripts (predefined settings, DB scripts,  
               etc.).                                                          
[lib] -------- holds specific versions of components of external libraries     
               used by a project (ActiveX controls, EXE, ...).                 
[src] -------- source texts directory (in addition to subfolders can contains  
               make file for entire project: components and applications).     
[apps] ------- base directory for applications.                                
[components] - components specific to more than one application in a project.  
               Components used in only one application should be placed as part
               of that application. When creating components that are reusable 
               across many applications, consider making those components part 
               of another project or repository.                               
[test] ------- directory contains project-wide tests.                          
[tmp] -------- a temporary directory, holding temporary files used by the build
               process. This directory either does not exist in the            
               configuration management system, or is empty there.             
[var] -------- directory containing data. This can range from XML data to HTML 
               pages to all other files that are not source files (are not     
               processed by the build process). Note that web-page scripting   
               files like PHP files also fall into this category.
